description: This project streamlines the user experience for Long Beach Rising's Bouldering League by automating key processes. Users can easily sign up, join or create teams, and log completed climbs. The app calculates points based on individual handicaps, updating leaderboards for each team. This automation promotes transparency within the league, boosts member engagement, and significantly reduces the manual workload previously required.
